# MachineLearning_HelloWorld

Welcome to my ML_hello_world repository. I am learning Data science and Machine Learniga and parallely building this repository. 

I will start with nuts and bolts of Data science and Machine Learning. And finally we will apply these learnt concepts on some famous academic datasets and some real world datasets (e.g.  kaggle or UCI repository)

:)
Happy_Learning !!
